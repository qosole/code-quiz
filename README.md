# Code Quiz

## Description 

A website with a simple JavaScript coding quiz. You will have 60 seconds to answer 5 basic questions about JavaScript. Each wrong answer subtracts 10 seconds from the clock. Your final score will be the number of questions you got right * 10 + time remaining. You can save your high score and view the high scores.

This website was my first adventure into the world of JavaScript, and it was very educational in modifying the page using JavaScript and creating an interactive webpage. It was also good practice in local storage, and how not to organize code (the way I approached creating this website made fixing bugs very tedious).
